## Part 1
### THREADS

In this part we created several text files and we calculated the total number of lines in these files.
We implemented this in three methods:
+  without threads
+ with threads
+ with ThreadPool

### createTextFiles
We write the createTextFiles method that created n file text and a rqndom number of lines.
This function return the names files' array.

### getNumOfLines
 We write the getNumOfLines method that get list of files and return the number  of total rows in all files. In this function we go over the files and calculated for each file the total number of lines.

### getNumOfLinesThreads
We write the getNumOfLinesThreads method that get list of files and return the total number of rows in all files. We created NumOfLinesThread class that extends Thread class.
In the run function we call the computeNumLines function. 

### getNumOfLinesThreadPool
We write the getNumOfLinesThreadPool method that get list of files and return the total number of rows in all files.
We created NumOfLinesThread class that implementes Callable<Integer> interface.
In the call function we call the computeNumLines function.

#### Running Time
We check the run time of 1,000 files with number or rows between 3-1,000.

We can see that the thredPool function is the fastier and then the thread function and in the end the function without threads.

 In a multi-threaded environment, sometimes we need to schedule tasks based on custom criteria instead of just the creation time.
In this part we will show how we can achieve this in Java â€“ using a PriorityBlockingQueue.

### TaskType
Is a enum that represent the task type and it priority 
### Task
The Task class represent a generic task with a task type and a priority.
This class implements Callable interface. 
The feilds class are Callable and TaskType.
To create an instance of Task we use factory method, it is why the constructor is private.
